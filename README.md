# Glasgow-University-Thesis-Template

LaTex Glasgow University PhD Thesis Template I have developed following the College of Social Sciences thesis formatting requirements. Besides on Github, it can be found on Overleaf as a template here (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/glasgow-university-phd-thesis-template/zptkqcxpvspt). This code has been adapted from Mathew Topper's Edinburgh Thesis template, original available here (https://bit.ly/3FK42HS).
