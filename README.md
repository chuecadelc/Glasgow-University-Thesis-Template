# Glasgow-University-Thesis-Template

LaTex Glasgow University PhD Thesis Template I have developed following the College of Social Sciences thesis formatting requirements. 
This code has been adapted from Mathew Topper's Edinburgh Thesis template, available here (https://bit.ly/3FK42HS). Besides on Github, it can be found on Overleaf as a template.
